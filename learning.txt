• Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.
• If you think education is expensive, try estimating the cost of ignorance.
• It is what we know already that often prevents us from learning.
• I never learned from a man who agreed with me.
• A man who asks is a fool for five minutes. A man who never asks is a fool for life.
• Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection.
